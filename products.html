            We’ve listened to people who want to start mural painting as a group,
            but don’t believe they have the time or the experience to start…
            <br><br>
            That’s why our range of technology provides solutions focused on
            making the art transferral step in the mural painting process
            simpler, and less time consuming.
            <br><br>
            You still get to paint! It just means that your designs and ideas,
            are replicated on the wall of your choosing without all of the hassle.
            <br><br>
            This also makes painting in groups an easier task,
            as organising what goes where in your mural becomes more streamlined.
            <br><br>
            Depending on your budget, or if you have any electronic assembly skills;
            you can either purchase a solution already assembled,
            you can purchase the parts for self-assembly at a reduced cost,
            or simply download the specifications and code to design it yourself for free!

                    Dotter is a compact and simple solution to artwork referencing.<br>
                    It assists with the art transferral process of replicating your designs for big surfaces!<br>
                    <br>
                    Simply load your artwork as a digital file onto its internal storage;<br>
                    Set the scale you wish to replicate your artwork.<br>
                    Next, place a pen, pencil, marker, or anything else you draw with into its central grasp.<br><br>
                    Place dotter against your target surface and designate where you want the center of
                    the design to be located. As you rub dotter across the surface, it will draw dots as
                    reference points for your image.<br><br>
                    All you need to do is connect the dots, and your set to paint!<br><br>
                    Dotter’s accurate referencing system allows you to set up linework for your art fast
                    and accurately, allowing you and your collaborators to paint without mistakes.<br>
